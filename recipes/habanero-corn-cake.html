    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This habanero honey sweet corn cake is spicy, sweet, savory, dense, moist, and very addictive! I also had no idea what to call this, as it's not really a cake, but it's also not a pie, or a pudding, or a custard, so I ended up with "cake" since it's inspired by sweet Mexican corn cake. No matter what you call this, it's phenomenal! Garnish with fresh fruit and top with cr√®me fraiche, sour cream, Mexican crema, or whipped cream and freshly grated lime zest.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups fresh corn kernels</li>
        <li>1 habanero pepper, seeded and diced</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/3 cup water</li>
        <li>1/3 cup honey</li>
        <li>2/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1/3 cup cornmeal</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously butter a 9-inch pie dish.</li>
        <li>Combine fresh corn kernels, habanero pepper, eggs, water, and honey in a bowl. Puree with an immersion blender until almost smooth. Add flour, melted butter, cornmeal, salt, and baking powder; whisk until combined.</li>
        <li>Transfer mixture into the greased pie dish. Shake gently to settle mixture into the dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until golden brown and a wooden skewer inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes. Let cool until warm or room temperature before serving.</li>
    </ol>
